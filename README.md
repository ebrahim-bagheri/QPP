Pre-retrieval Query Performance Prediction

This work has been implemented by Naresh Kumar Sirwani <nsirwani@ryerson.ca> with help from Negar Arabzadehghahyazi <narabzad@ryerson.ca> and Ebrahim Bagheri <bagheri@ryerson.ca>.

The implementation includes pre-retrieval query performance prediction measures from: Estimating the Query Difficulty for Information Retrieval Front Cover David Carmel, Elad Yom-Tov Morgan & Claypool Publishers, 2010.

Note should be taken that query performance estimates used as baseline are related to the neural retrieval method introduced in the following paper over the Robust04 dataset: 

Bagheri, E., Ensan, F., & Al-Obeidat, F. (2018). Neural word and entity embeddings for ad hoc retrieval. Information Processing & Management, 54(4), 657-673.
